      - title: D3
        content: D3 continues to gain traction as a library for creating rich visualisations in the browser. Previously, it was somewhat low-level, requiring more work for the creation of commonly used visualisations than less sophisticated, more targeted libraries. Since the last radar, libraries like Rickshaw for charting and Crossfilter for in-browser dataset exploration have helped make D3 even more accessible than before.
      - title: Embedded servlet containers
        content: In previous radars we have talked about embedded servlet containers, and these are now widely adopted on our projects. Tools such as SimpleWeb and Webbit take the simple, embedded approach further and offer raw HTTP server functionality without implementing the Java Servlet specification. At the same time, Tomcat, the most popular Java application server, is increasingly used in embedded setups and Microsoft provides self-hosted servers for the .NET framework, lending further weight to this trend.
      - title: Frank
        content: Frank is an open source library that allows functional tests for iOS written in Cucumber and executed on a remote device. This fills an important niche where acceptance test-driven development was previously cumbersome and awkward.
      - title: Gradle
        content: Language-based build tools like Gradle and Rake continue to offer finer-grained abstractions and more flexibility long term than XML and plug-in based tools like Ant and Maven. This allows them to grow gracefully as projects become more complex.

      - title: NuGet
        content: Package systems for third-party library management continue to gain acceptance and features across all platforms. We called out NuGet as a recent entry, and the addition of Chocolatey NuGet exemplifies the advances and capabilities springing up around this essential agile engineering practice.

      - title: Gatling
        content: Gatling is another newer player in the automated performance testing space. It is similar to Locust and is much lighter weight than the older options such as JMeter and Grinder. Built on Scala, the DSL provides extensive functionality out of the box including easily configured data feeds and response assertions. In cases where customization is needed, it is easy to drop into Scala to provide extensions. The default generation of numerous dynamic views of the data via Highcharts adds to its appeal.

      - title: Logstash & Graylog2
        content: As the systems we build involve more fine-grained services spread across more machines than ever before, the challenge of how to get information aggregated to allow for easy problem identification and resolution is more pressing than ever. Logstash has emerged as an easy way to parse and filter logs at source, and then forward them to a single aggregation point. Although Logstash provides some searching and filtering, Graylog2 is often used in conjunction to provide for more fully-featured querying and reporting.
      - title: PhantomJS
        content: We see interest on ThoughtWorks projects around PhantomJS, a headless web testing tool that allows functional testing against a realistic target.
      - title: Puppet-librarian and Chef-librarian
        content: Both Puppet and Chef have had to deal with sharing community-contributed modules and manifests for commonly used services and tasks. Both the Puppet Forge and Chef’s Cookbook repository have helped, but people ended up copying and pasting these recipes into their own codebases, preventing them from taking advantage of later bugfixes and improvements. Puppet-librarian and Chef-librarian attempt to solve this by making it easy to declare your module dependencies, including pulling in known versions of code from these community sites.
      - title: TestFlight & HockeyApp
        content: Both TestFlight and HockeyApp allow you to manage the deployment of mobile applications without an app store, making user testing easier. They offer crash reporting and analytic capabilities to gather data in the field. HockeyApp supports IOS, Android, & Windows Phone, while TestFlight supports iOS and Android. We have used both tools successfully to help deliver mobile applications. This is clearly a fast evolving space.

      - title: Browser-based templating
        content: We see several JavaScript frameworks embrace browser-based templating, moving more layout work to the client. While this approach is useful in many cases, it does introduce operational issues involving caching, performance, and search. We believe these tools should be assessed carefully to ensure suitability for the target deployment environment.
      - title: Faraday
        content: Several ThoughtWorks teams called out the usefulness of Faraday, a Ruby HTTP client library that provides a common interface over a variety of adapters and integrates nicely with Rack middleware.
      - title: Hystrix
        content: Managing dependencies in distributed systems can become complicated, and is a problem more people are facing with the move to finer-grained micro services. Hystrix is a library for the JVM from Netflix that implements patterns for dealing with downstream failure, offers real-time monitoring of connections, and caching and batching mechanisms to make inter-service dependencies more effic

      - title: Octopus
        content: Windows infrastructure automation should be adopted, however it still remains more difficult than automation on a Unix platform. Tools like Chef and Puppet are increasing their support, but there are also Windows specific solutions being developed like Octopus. Octopus allows automated deployment of your ASP.NET applications and Windows services and decreases dependency on PowerShell. It can be used with both NuGet using Octopak and TeamCity to create a full build, package, and deployment pipeline.
      - title: Reactive Extensions for .Net
        content: By putting IObservables and IObservers on an equal footing with IEnumerables and IEnumerators, Rx for .NET allows developers to use their existing knowledge of LINQ (Language INtegrated Query) operators to query and compose asynchronous operations and event-based code using a common underlying abstraction of observable event streams. Microsoft has also released RxJS to bring the benefits of reactive programming to JavaScript. They open sourced the entire Rx framework, making it useful for Windows rich client applications and single-page JavaScript applications.

      - title: Snowplow Analytics
        content: We see great promise in Snowplow Analytics, an open source web analytics platform that derives intelligent information from regular web analytics, based on open data principles and cloud storage.
      - title: UIAutomator
        content: UIAutomator looks like the most promising tool for testing Android user interfaces by allowing fine-grained control over components during test and facilitating testing on multiple devices. With the rise of devices with multiple form factors and pixel densities, the issue of presenting high quality icons at all scales has become important. Icon fonts solve this problem by using browser support for WebFonts and SVG instead of scaled images or maintaining different icon sets. As always, when making extensive use of SVG, pay attention to power consumption on mobile devices and performance on older devices.

      - title: Heavyweight test tools
        content: Many organizations that have moved to more agile ways of working continue to use heavyweight testing tools. These tools have problems that make them unsuitable for fast moving software delivery. Large complex tools have high learning curves and require specialist skills and training, making it hard for the team themselves to test. Often this results in an unnecessary overhead for every release as other teams get involved. Expensive and limiting software licenses makes this problem even worse. Some heavyweight tools use a “model driven” approach where an attempt is made to accurately model the usage patterns of the application, which leads to costly test script maintenance and development time being lost to “false positives.” We have seen few situations where simple open source solutions cannot give the required level of confidence for much less time, effort and money.
      - title: Maven
        content: Language-based build tools like Gradle and Rake continue to offer finer-grained abstractions and more flexibility long term than XML and plug-in based tools like Ant and Maven. This allows them to grow gracefully as projects become more complex.
      - title: TFS
        content: We continue to see teams run into productivity problems attempting to use TFS as a version control system. Teams that want to practice frequent code checkins, a core part of continuous integration, have found its heavyweight approach significantly drains productivity. This often leads to teams checking in less frequently, causing more problematic merges. We recommend tools such as Git, Perforce, and Subversion instead.
